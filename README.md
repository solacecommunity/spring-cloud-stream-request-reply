This project requires the TMS CapaOpt codestyle,
which is maintained in the [tms-intellij-settings](https://code.sbb.ch/projects/PT_TMS_CAPAOPT/repos/intellij-settings) repository.
If you haven't done so already, configure it as a read-only settings repository:

`File > Settings > Tools > Settings Repository`

Add `https://code.sbb.ch/scm/pt_tms_capaopt/intellij-settings.git` to your read-only sources.

Note that SSH repository-URLs don't work due to a bug in the settings repository feature.
